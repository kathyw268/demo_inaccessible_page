    <h2>How to Lower your Carbon Footprint</h2>
    <h3>Compost</h3>
      <p>
        Tackle food waste by turning it into nutrient rich compost. Nearly 40% of food is being thrown out and accumulating in landfills.Â By composting we can reduce 23% of methane emissions in the US and add nutrients to our gardens and farms. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home">Composting is easy to do at home</a> or you can drop off your food scraps and a <a href="https://www.grownyc.org/compost">compost collection site</a>.
      </p>
    <h3>Eat Less Meat, Especially Beef</h3>
    <p>
      The agriculture industry is the leading producer of greenhouse emissions. This is due to the large quantity of livestock needed to sustain our eating habits and the resources used to feed and process them. Cattle raised for beef produces 4 times the emissions per kilogram compared to chickens and over 30 times more than vegetables.

    <p>
      Cutting down on meat is good for your health too. Red meat has been linked to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. While going vegetarian and vegan would have the most impact, limiting the consumption of meat and moving towards a plant-based diet will make a significant change. A lot of people are adopting flexitarian diets and planning Meatless Monday meals.

    <h3>Refuse/Reuse What you can</h3>
    <p>
      Eliminate disposables such as plastic utensils, shopping bags, cling wrap and etc. by replacing them with reusable alternatives. <a href="http://www.reuseit.com/reusable-shopping-bags.htm">Grocery bags</a> now come in a bunch of different sizes and are compact enough to carry around. Cloth napkins can be used instead of paper napkins. There are even reusable cloth version of cotton rounds, wet wipes, and menstrual pads (menstural cups are a good alternative too).
    </p>
    <h3>Buy Second Hand</h3>
    <p>
      Save money by buying second hand items. You can find vintage clothes and furniture at your local thrift shop and save a lot of money. Buying pre-owned items means you are decreasing the waste that comes from the manufacturing process. Manufacturing textiles can contminate water sources and factory conditions are known to be dangerous for the workers.
